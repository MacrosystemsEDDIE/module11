intro_eco_forecast,"Advances in environmental sensor technology in recent decades permit collection of environmental data at high temporal frequencies (e.g., every 10 minutes) across many ecosystems. These time series of environmental data can be used to gain information about the previous and current state of ecosystems, as well as make predictions about ecosystem states in the future. To help researchers and managers understand the complex patterns that can occur in high-frequency time series data, time series models are commonly applied in ecology and environmental science. These models use statistical and machine learning methods to identify signals in high-frequency environmental data."
this_module,"In this module, students will apply several different time series and machine learning models to environmental data. They will explore data from an environmental case study of their choice, choose which environmental variables to use to fit a time series model, assess the model, and use it to make predictions. Then, they will fit several other models to the same time series data and compare predictive performance across models. They will also evaluate the ecological implications that can be drawn from each model (e.g., which variables are important for explaining the dynamics of the target variable for prediction)."
goal,"The overarching goal of this module is for students to learn fundamental concepts about time series modeling, fit time series models to environmental data, and evaluate model fit and predictive performance. Students will work with an R Shiny interface to visualize data, build a model, generate predictions, and then compare predictions across models. The A-B-C structure of this module makes it flexible and adaptable to a range of student levels and course structures."

act_A,Activity A - Visualize data from a selected case study and fit and assess a time series model
act_B,Activity B - Choose a new dataset or upload your own dataset and fit and assess a time series model
act_C,Activity C - Fit additional time series models to your environmental dataset and compare performance across models
time_series_model,A time series model is a data analysis tool that uses statistics and machine learning techniques to identify and represent patterns in data collected over time.
models_applied,"Recent advances in environmental sensor technology now permit the collection of high-frequency environmental data over time, leading to large dataset that are suitable for fitting and assessing time series models. Moreover, time series models can often identify and predict patterns in data that would be difficult to capture using other approaches."
oos_prediction,"Out-of-sample prediction is using a model to make predictions for data that were not used to fit the model in the first place. So for example, if data from 2020-2024 are used to fit a model, using the model to make predictions for 2025 would be out-of-sample prediction."
standardized_data,"Data standards dictate the format of a dataset: what columns should be included, what type of data should be found in each column, and so on. All time series models require data to be a in a particular format to be used by the model. While the details of required formats differ among models, learning how to read and interpret data standards and create standardized datasets is a necessary skill for fitting time series models to data."
compare_models,"Comparing across multiple models allows us to better understand how well each individual model is performing. Often, when we compare models, we compare more complex models to simple baseline, or null, models. If the performance of the null models and the complex models is similar, we learn that adding complexity to our model does not result in increased predictive performance. Some models may perform better than others under specific environmental conditions, but we cannot know this if we do not compare."

workflow1,"After the instructor completes the PowerPoint presentation, students will launch the Shiny app and download the final report template as a Word document, which they will fill in as they work through the Shiny app. Students work in pairs to navigate through the upper tabs (e.g., ""Introduction"", ""Exploration"", ""Activity A"", ""Activity B"", and ""Activity C"")  to complete each of the objectives for that activity. Within each activity tab, there are tabs corresponding to each environmental case study (e.g., within Activity A, there are tabs for the ""Aquatic"", ""Terrestrial"", and ""Disease"" case studies)."
workflow2,"There are questions in blue text boxes embedded throughout the Shiny app which correspond to the questions in the final report. Students should input their answers into the final report Word document. In addition, students will be cued to download visualizations generated throughout the module and copy-paste them into the final report. "

obj_01,"Select a case study from the table, then read the text in the 'About Case Study' section to find out more about the case study."
obj_02,"Explore the data measured at the selected site, including how each variable changes over time and how the variables relate to each other."
obj_03,"We will use the environmental data from your case study to fit an ARIMA model that will predict future values of the target variable. But first, we will learn about how ARIMA models are used for time series prediction."
obj_04,"Using your understanding of aquatic ecosystems, you will build a simple ecological model to predict primary productivity."
obj_05,Test different scenarios with your model to understand how it will respond under different environmental conditions. Use observed data to calibrate the model (i.e. make your model better match observed data).
obj_06,Gain an understanding of what uncertainty is in the context of an ecological forecast and explore weather forecast data. Demonstrate how uncertainty can be quantified.
obj_07,"Using observed data from your lake site, you will build a linear model to convert air temperature to surface water temperature and shortwave radiation (SWR) to underwater photosynthetic active radiation (uPAR), which are the inputs required for your primary productivity model. "
obj_08,Use forecasted water temperature and uPAR and up-to-date initial conditions to drive your calibrated model into the future and forecast primary productivity.
obj_09,Forecasts that are effectively communicated to the public and managers will be most useful for aiding decision-making. Here you will think about how to communicate your forecast to an end-user.
obj_10,A fundamental part of the forecast cycle is assessing how well your forecast performed relative to observations. Here we will use a simple assessment of plotting forecast results against observations.
obj_11,Update our model to improve our forecasts based on the recent observations that have been collected. 
obj_12,"The forecast cycle is an iterative process. Now after communicating and assessing our forecast and updating our model parameters, we will update our driver forecasts and initial conditions to generate the next forecast. "
obj_13, Make a hypothesis about how you expect your model to forecast primary productivitiy at a different NEON site. Then test your hypothesis by repeating Activity A Objectives 1 & 5 and Activity B with the other NEON site.
weather_forecast2,"Weather forecasts are created using multiple runs from the same model, but the initial conditions of the model are altered to generate different potential futures."
model1,"A model is a representation (physical, conceptual or mathematical) of a real phenomenon that is difficult to observe directly."
model2,"Models can be as simple as a verbal statement represented by two boxes connected by an arrow to show a relationship such as, “warmer air temperature causes warmer lake surface temperature” or “a higher number of wolves leads to a lower population of deer""."
model3,"Alternatively, models can be extremely complex and detailed, such as a mathematical description of the pathways of nitrogen transformations within ecosystems."
mod_desc,The model we will be using in this module is the nutrient-phytoplankton (NP) model. The nutrient-phytoplankton (NP) model is a common tool in freshwater and marine research. The NP model represents the simplest sets of processes needed to model plankton dynamics.
phyto_chla,"Phytoplankton are primary producers. They take up nitrogen and other nutrients to photosynthesize (i.e., use sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide and water). Chlorophyll-a is used as a proxy (i.e. indirect measurement) of the phytoplankton concentration in water. We will use chlorophyll-a  sensor measurements from the lake and assume the concentration of chlorophyll-a is equal to the concentration of phytoplankton for the purposes of this module."
uncert1,"Uncertainty comes from natural variation and imperfect knowledge. For example, taking replicate samples is one way to estimate uncertainty in observations  whereas imperfect knowledge is reflected in our models, such as the NP model. This model, like many other ecological models, makes assumptions that we know are simplistic representations of reality. One such assumption is that phytoplankton nutrient uptake occurs at a constant parameter rate. It is known that many different species of phytoplankton take up nitrogen at different rates but to reduce model complexity one rate is assumed for all phytoplankton. In addition to process (model) uncertainty, observational uncertainty, and parameter uncertainty, other sources of uncertainty are drivers and initial conditions."
driver_uncert,"The driver variables of our primary productivity model are surface water temperature and underwater photosynthetically active radiation (uPAR). However, NOAA provides forecasts of air temperature and shortwave radiation, not water temperature and uPAR. Therefore, to generate a forecast of future productivity, we will convert the NOAA forecast using relationships between air temperature and surface water temperature and shortwave radiation and uPAR. We will use the resulting water temperature and uPAR forecasts to drive your primary productivity model."
param_uncert,"Parameter uncertainty refers to the uncertainty in the model parameter values, which can be due to uncertainties in the data or the calibration process used."
init_uncert,Initial conditions uncertainty refers to uncertainty arising because the initial conditions are not precisely known or because the calculations cannot be performed with the precise initial conditions.
comm_forecast,Answer Q 23 in the student handout.
state_var,"State variables describe the properties (or state, hence ""state"" variables) of an ecosystem at a moment in time. Phytoplankton biomass and nutrient concentration are examples of state variables in our lake model: they describe the state, or conditions, of the lake ecosystem at a particular time. The value of a state variable can increase or decrease over time (e.g., phytoplankton biomass may increase or decrease over time in a lake). The rate at which state variables increase or decrease is determined by the model parameters. In our model diagram, state variables are represented by green boxes."
parameter,"A parameter is a variable describing the rate of change in the state variables of a model. For example, the rate of change in phytoplankton biomass may be governed by a maximum growth rate parameter describing how quickly phytoplankton can grow. In our model diagram, parameters are contained within the processes represented by the green and blue arrows."
driver,"Drivers are variables for which we need data to run our model. Similar to state variables, driver variables describe the conditions of an ecosystem at a point in time. However, unlike state variables, we cannot run the model without driver variable data as input. For example, we need water temperature and shortwave radiation data to run our lake ecosystem model; if we do not have those inputs, the model cannot run. In our model diagram, drivers are represented by the sun and thermometer icons. "
fc_cycle_end,"We have now stepped through each of the steps in the forecast cycle. As you can see, forecasting is an iterative process. We constantly will need to generate forecasts of the future as time moves forward. When we combine our forecasts with data, we can use this data to update our model, which will then improve our model the more forecasts we make. "
