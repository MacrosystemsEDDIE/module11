intro_eco_forecast,"Advances in environmental sensor technology in recent decades permit collection of environmental data at high temporal frequencies (e.g., every 10 minutes) across many ecosystems. These time series of environmental data can be used to gain information about the previous and current state of ecosystems, as well as make predictions about ecosystem states in the future. To help researchers and managers understand the complex patterns that can occur in high-frequency time series data, time series models are commonly applied in ecology and environmental science. These models use statistical and machine learning methods to identify signals in high-frequency environmental data."
this_module,"In this module, students will apply several different time series and machine learning models to environmental data. They will explore data from an environmental case study of their choice, choose which environmental variables to use to fit a time series model, assess the model, and use it to make predictions. Then, they will process a new dataset into a standardized format, upload it into the module, and fit several other models to compare predictive performance across models. They will also evaluate the ecological implications that can be drawn from each model (e.g., which variables are important for explaining the dynamics of the target variable for prediction)."
goal,"The overarching goal of this module is for students to learn fundamental concepts about time series modeling, fit time series models to environmental data, and evaluate model fit and predictive performance. Students will work with an R Shiny interface to visualize data, build a model, generate predictions, and then compare predictions across models. The A-B-C structure of this module makes it flexible and adaptable to a range of student levels and course structures."
EDDIE,"Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) is a suite of education projects composed of STEM disciplinary and educational researchers. We develop flexible classroom teaching modules using large, publicly available datasets to engage students in STEM and improve their quantitative reasoning. Teaching modules span topics such as ecology, limnology, geology, hydrology, and environmental sciences. EDDIE also helps build the associated professional development needed to ensure effective use of the teaching modules."

time_series_model,A time series model is a data analysis tool that uses statistics and machine learning techniques to identify and represent patterns in data collected over time.
models_applied,"Recent advances in environmental sensor technology now permit the collection of high-frequency environmental data over time, leading to large dataset that are suitable for fitting and assessing time series models. Moreover, time series models can often identify and predict patterns in data that would be difficult to capture using other approaches."
oos_prediction,"Out-of-sample prediction is using a model to make predictions for data that were not used to fit the model in the first place. So for example, if data from 2020-2024 are used to fit a model, using the model to make predictions for 2025 would be out-of-sample prediction."
standardized_data,"Data standards dictate the format of a dataset: what columns should be included, what type of data should be found in each column, and so on. All time series models require data to be a in a particular format to be used by the model. While the details of required formats differ among models, learning how to read and interpret data standards and create standardized datasets is a necessary skill for fitting time series models to data."
compare_models,"Comparing across multiple models allows us to better understand how well each individual model is performing. Often, when we compare models, we compare more complex models to simple baseline, or null, models. If the performance of the null models and the complex models is similar, we learn that adding complexity to our model does not result in increased predictive performance. Some models may perform better than others under specific environmental conditions, but we cannot know this if we do not compare."

workflow1,"After the instructor completes the PowerPoint presentation, students will launch the Shiny app and download the final report template as a Word document, which they will fill in as they work through the Shiny app. Students work in pairs to navigate through the upper tabs (e.g., ""Introduction"", ""Exploration"", ""Activity A"", ""Activity B"", and ""Activity C"")  to complete each of the objectives for that activity. Within each activity tab, there are tabs corresponding to each environmental case study (e.g., within Activity A, there are tabs for the ""Aquatic"", ""Terrestrial"", and ""Disease"" case studies)."

cann,"The Canning River sampling site (latitude: -32.02118152460639; longitude: 115.92075004307715; elevation: 2 m) is part of the Swan-Canning Estuary, an urban estuary system that runs through Perth, the capital of Western Australia. Freshwater flushing from terrestrial catchments and salt water intrusion from the Indian Ocean leads to complex hydrology and biogeochemistry, while increasing nutrient loading from human activity, resulting in water quality impacts for this drinking water supply. Our focal target variable for this case study is chlorophyll-a, a photosynthetic pigment that is commonly used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. Phytoplankton are tiny aquatic organisms which are key primary producers in many aquatic ecosystems. However, over-proliferation of phytoplankton can lead to harmful blooms, which can release toxins, cause taste and odor problems, and form unsightly scums. Chlorophyll-a can be measured using high-frequency sensors deployed on buoys. Periodically, the Swan-Canning Estuary and the Canning River experience harmful blooms of various phytoplankton species. This can lead to fish kills, fisheries warnings, and recreational area closures. Models that can provide predictions of high chlorophyll-a levels can be a useful tool as managers try to anticipate and mitigate the effects of these blooms. The data for the Canning River case study are retrieved from the Swan-Canning Estuary Virtual Observatory, or SCEVO, which is operated by the University of Western Australia."

bart,"Bartlett Experimental Forest, NH, USA is a terrestrial field site within the U.S. National Ecological Observatory Network. The site is an old-growth northern deciduous hardwood forest (primarily beech and maple) located within the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire, USA. The site was historically logged but has been dedicated as a research monitoring station established since 1931. It is currently managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service. Our focal target variable for the Bartlett Experimental Forest is net ecosystem exchange, or NEE. NEE is the net exchange of carbon between the air and a terrestrial ecosystem. The magnitude of NEE depends on the rates of photosynthesis and respiration of the ecosystem’s vegetation. If NEE is positive, the ecosystem is emitting carbon to the atmosphere; if it is negative, the ecosystem is taking up carbon. Understanding the magnitude and patterns in NEE has important climate implications. NEE measures the exchange of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. As a result, NEE measures the degree to which an ecosystem contributes to or mitigates climate change. Because NEE is affected by temperature and moisture, changes in climate can affect NEE, creating a feedback loop between ecosystems and climate. NEE is measured by high-frequency sensors deployed on towers which extend above the canopy of an ecosystem. Our data source for the Bartlett Experimental Forest case study is the U.S. National Ecological Observatory Network, or NEON, which coordinates comprehensive collection of ecological data from a variety of ecosystems across the U.S. "
