intro_eco_forecast,"Advances in environmental sensor technology in recent decades permit collection of environmental data at high temporal frequencies (e.g., every 10 minutes) across many ecosystems. These time series of environmental data can be used to gain information about the previous and current state of ecosystems, as well as make predictions about ecosystem states in the future. To help researchers and managers understand the complex patterns that can occur in high-frequency time series data, time series models are commonly applied in ecology and environmental science. These models use statistical and machine learning methods to identify signals in high-frequency environmental data."
this_module,"In this module, students will apply several different time series and machine learning models to environmental data. They will explore data from an environmental case study of their choice, choose which environmental variables to use to fit a time series model, assess the model, and use it to make predictions. Then, they will fit several other models to the same time series data and compare predictive performance across models. They will also evaluate the ecological implications that can be drawn from each model (e.g., which variables are important for explaining the dynamics of the target variable for prediction)."
goal,"The overarching goal of this module is for students to learn fundamental concepts about time series modeling, fit time series models to environmental data, and evaluate model fit and predictive performance. Students will work with an R Shiny interface to visualize data, build a model, generate predictions, and then compare predictions across models. The A-B-C structure of this module makes it flexible and adaptable to a range of student levels and course structures."
EDDIE,"Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) is a suite of education projects composed of STEM disciplinary and educational researchers. We develop flexible classroom teaching modules using large, publicly available datasets to engage students in STEM and improve their quantitative reasoning. Teaching modules span topics such as ecology, limnology, geology, hydrology, and environmental sciences. EDDIE also helps build the associated professional development needed to ensure effective use of the teaching modules."
act_A,Activity A - Visualize data from a selected case study and fit and assess a time series model
act_B,Activity B - Choose a new dataset or upload your own dataset and fit and assess a time series model
act_C,Activity C - Fit additional time series models to your environmental dataset and compare performance across models
time_series_model,A time series model is a data analysis tool that uses statistics and machine learning techniques to identify and represent patterns in data collected over time.
models_applied,"Recent advances in environmental sensor technology now permit the collection of high-frequency environmental data over time, leading to large dataset that are suitable for fitting and assessing time series models. Moreover, time series models can often identify and predict patterns in data that would be difficult to capture using other approaches."
oos_prediction,"Out-of-sample prediction is using a model to make predictions for data that were not used to fit the model in the first place. So for example, if data from 2020-2024 are used to fit a model, using the model to make predictions for 2025 would be out-of-sample prediction."
standardized_data,"Data standards dictate the format of a dataset: what columns should be included, what type of data should be found in each column, and so on. All time series models require data to be a in a particular format to be used by the model. While the details of required formats differ among models, learning how to read and interpret data standards and create standardized datasets is a necessary skill for fitting time series models to data."
compare_models,"Comparing across multiple models allows us to better understand how well each individual model is performing. Often, when we compare models, we compare more complex models to simple baseline, or null, models. If the performance of the null models and the complex models is similar, we learn that adding complexity to our model does not result in increased predictive performance. Some models may perform better than others under specific environmental conditions, but we cannot know this if we do not compare."

workflow1,"After the instructor completes the PowerPoint presentation, students will launch the Shiny app and download the final report template as a Word document, which they will fill in as they work through the Shiny app. Students work in pairs to navigate through the upper tabs (e.g., ""Introduction"", ""Exploration"", ""Activity A"", ""Activity B"", and ""Activity C"")  to complete each of the objectives for that activity. Within each activity tab, there are tabs corresponding to each environmental case study (e.g., within Activity A, there are tabs for the ""Aquatic"", ""Terrestrial"", and ""Disease"" case studies)."
workflow2,"There are questions in blue text boxes embedded throughout the Shiny app which correspond to the questions in the final report. Students should input their answers into the final report Word document. In addition, students will be cued to download visualizations generated throughout the module and copy-paste them into the final report. "
workflow3,"Once students have completed all three activities, the final report may be submitted to the instructor for assessment."
workflow4,"When working through Activity A, we encourage you to save your progress regularly by clicking ""Bookmark my Activity A progress"" and copying the (quite long!) link to a secure location. When pasted into your web browser, this link will load a Shiny app session that contains your progress. You will not be able to save your progress in Activities B and C as these activities require users to upload their own data, which we do not store within the app. Please budget 45-60 minutes to complete Activities B and C."
