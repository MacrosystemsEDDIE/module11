q1,Q1. Why is close attention to data standards needed when using time series models in environmental science? What are the risks of not following data standards?
q2,Q2. How can use of time series models improve both natural resource management and ecological understanding?
q3,Q3. Fill out information about your selected case study site:
q3a,a. Name of selected site
q3b,b. Four letter site identifier
q3c,c. Latitude
q3d,d. Longitude
q3e,f. Elevation (m)
q4,Q4. What is the desired target variable for prediction in the case study you have chosen? Why is that variable important for ecosystem function and management?
q5,Q5. Fill out the table in your Word document with the description of site variables:
q5a,a. Variable name
q5b,b. Units
q5c,c. Maximum value
q5d,d. Minimum value
q5e,e. Mean value
q6,"Q6. Describe the relationship between each variable and the target variable. For each variable, write in the table in your Word document whether increases in that variable are associated with increases in the target variable (positive relationship), decreases in the target variable (negative relationship), or no change in the target variable (no relationship).

q7,"Q7. Describe the three components of an ARIMA model (autoregressive, integrated, moving average) in your own words."
q8,Q8. Observe the plot on the right. Does the target variable exhibit autocorrelation at a 1-day lag? Explain how you know.
q9,"Q9. Observe the PACF plot on the right. Based on this figure, how many lags of the target variable do you anticipate being included in the fitted ARIMA model? Explain your reasoning."
q10,"Q10. Observe the plot on the right. Based on visual inspection, does differencing substantially improve the stationarity of the target variable data? Explain your reasoning."
