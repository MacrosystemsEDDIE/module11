q1,Q1. Why is close attention to data standards needed when using time series models in environmental science? What are the risks of not following data standards?
q2,Q2. How can use of time series models improve both natural resource management and ecological understanding?
q3,Q3. Fill out information about your selected case study site:
q3a,a. Name of selected site
q3b,b. Four letter site identifier
q3c,c. Latitude
q3d,d. Longitude
q3e,f. Elevation (m)
q4,Q4. What is the desired target variable for prediction in the case study you have chosen? Why is that variable important for ecosystem function and management?
q5,Q5. Fill out the table in your Word document with the description of site variables:
q5a,a. Variable name
q5b,b. Units
q5c,c. Maximum value
q5d,d. Minimum value
q5e,e. Mean value
q6,"Q6. Describe the relationship between each variable and the target variable. For each variable, write in the table in your Word document whether increases in that variable are associated with increases in the target variable (positive relationship), decreases in the target variable (negative relationship), or no change in the target variable (no relationship). "
q7,"Q7. Describe the three components of an ARIMA model (autoregressive, integrated, moving average) in your own words."
q8,Q8. Observe the plot on the right. Does the target variable exhibit autocorrelation at a 1-day lag? Explain how you know.
q9,"Q9. Observe the PACF plot on the right. Based on this figure, how many lags of the target variable do you anticipate being included in the fitted ARIMA model? Explain your reasoning."
q10,"Q10. Observe the plot on the right. Based on visual inspection, does differencing substantially improve the stationarity of the target variable data? Explain your reasoning."
q11,"Q11. List up to three exogenous regressors that you would like to include in your fitted ARIMA model. For each regressor, explain why you chose to include it in the model. If you choose not to include any regressors, explain your reasoning."
q12,"Q12. Examine the (p, d, q) order of your ARIMA model printed above. Interpret the order of your ARIMA."
q12a,a. How many lags are included in the model? How do you know?
q12b,b. Are the data differenced to fit the model? How do you know?
q12c,c. How many timesteps of previous errors are included in the model? How do you know?
q13,"Q13. Which term is most important in your fitted model (i.e., has the greatest absolute value)?"
q14,"Q14. If the standard error of a term is bigger than the absolute value of the estimate of a term, we cannot say for sure that the effect of that term is meaningfully different from 0. Are there any terms in your model that are not meaningfully different from 0? Which ones?"
q15,"Q15. Assess the importance of the exogenous regressors you chose to include in the model. Based on the term estimates and standard errors, were these variables important in your final, fitted model? Explain your reasoning."
q16,Q16. Inspect the plot on the right. How well do you think the model predictions fit the observations in the test dataset? Explain your reasoning.
q17,Q17. Briefly describe in your own words how a 95% predictive interval can be estimated using the standard deviation of the model residuals.
q18,Q18. Record the standard deviation of the model residuals.
q19,"Q19. Inspect the plot of model predictions with uncertainty. Now that you can see the uncertainty associated with model predictions, how well do you think the model predictions fit the observations in the test dataset? Explain your reasoning."
q20,Q20. Compare your answers to Q16 and Q19. Were there any differences in your interpretation of model fit when you visualized predictions with and without uncertainty? Why do you think this might be?
q21,Q21. Briefly (a) define the ignorance score and (b) describe how it is calculated in your own words.
q22,"Q22. Click ""Calculate ignorance score"" and record the value of the ignorance score for your fitted ARIMA model."
q23,Q23. Compare the ignorance score for your model to your partner's model. Whose model scored better? How do you know?
