q1,Q1. Why is close attention to data standards needed when using time series models in environmental science? What are the risks of not following data standards?
q2,Q2. How can use of time series models improve both natural resource management and ecological understanding?
q3,Q3. Fill out information about your selected case study site:
q3a,a. Name of selected site
q3b,b. Four letter site identifier
q3c,c. Latitude
q3d,d. Longitude
q3e,f. Elevation (m)
q4,Q4. What is the desired target variable for prediction in the case study you have chosen? Why is that variable important for ecosystem function and management?
q5,Q4. Fill out the table in your Word document with the description of site variables:
q5a,Air temperature
q5b,Surface water temperature
q5c,Nitrogen
q5d,Underwater PAR
q5e,Chlorophyll-a
q6,"Q5. Describe the effect of each of the following variables on chlorophyll-a. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) is used as a proxy measurement for phytoplankton concentration and primary productivity in aquatic environments. For each variable, write in the table whether increases in that variable are associated with increases in chl-a (positive relationship), decreases in chl-a (negative relationship), or no change in chl-a (no relationship). "

q6b,Surface water temperature
q6c,Nitrogen
q6d,Underwater PAR
q7,"Q6. Describe the relationship between each of these driving variables and productivity according to the ecosystem model we are using today (depicted above). For example, if the driving variable increases, will it cause productivity to increase (positive), decrease (negative), or have no effect (stay the same)."
